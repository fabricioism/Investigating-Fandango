# Investigating Fandango Movie Ratings
In this project we will analyze more recent movie ratings data whether there has been any change in Fandango's rating system after Walt Hickey's analysis (https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fandango-movies-ratings/).

Walt Hickey made the data he analyzed publicly available on GitHub. We'll use the data he collected to analyze the characteristics of Fandango's rating system previous to his analysis. (https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/fandango)

This is a guided project proposed by Dataquest Labs, as part of the training in the data analysis specialization path.
